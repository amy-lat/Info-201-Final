<h3>Is there a relationship between the socioeconomic status of a county and the number of fatal police shootings in that county?</h3>
<p>Below is an interactive visualization of police shootings from 2015 distributed by various social and economic factors. It takes the form of a histogram, which shows the count of the data falling into each ’ <em>bin</em> on the x-axis. Histograms are excellent for revealing potential cause and effect relationships in data. <iframe data-deferred-src="appbf8fee9e306d1058504ed07b70d19b62/?w=&amp;__subapp__=1" width="100%" height="400" class="shiny-frame shiny-frame-deferred"></iframe></p>

<p>Noticeably, this graph shows that whites were killed more often than any minority. This finding does not fit with current conversations relating to police violence, which often claim that minorities are disproportionately affected by police killings. This graph must be supplemented with United States Census data to understand the full picture, or it is otherwise misleading.</p>
<p>Below is table of the nation’s racial demographics <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US#viewtop">according to census data from 2016</a>.</p>

<p>Although people of color make up 39% of the United States population, they accounted for 48% of fatal police shootings in 2015. This difference of 9% is <em>disproportionately more</em> than their demographic. Based on this analysis alone there seems to be merit to an idea portrayed nearly univerally in the media, without much evidence: that people of color are more often at the receving end of police brutality than white people.</p>

<h3>Have the number of police killings changed in the past few years?</h3>
<p>The answer to that question, tragically, is <strong>no</strong>. Below is an interactive plot of all fatal police shootings from 2015-present. Steadily, there have been about 30 police killings per month since 2015. The deaths of Philando Castile and Eric Garner are marked below, and not even the nation-wide outcry against those deaths had a measurable affect on police shootings.</p>
