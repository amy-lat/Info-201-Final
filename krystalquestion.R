## In America the percentage of people who are White are about 70% leaving the rest of the
## people colored of "unidentified". If you add up the values for those who are of color vs.
## the amount of were killed who were white, ignoring the "unknown" column, you can see that
## the numbers are almost even. However, this reveals that more people of color were killed
## in the year of 2014 in all of the US compared to white people as the population of 
## white people are higher so less white people died altogether. This is true to what the 
## media displays as well, as we see in the media that usually more people of color are killed
## compared to white people. 

## https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US#viewtop

## According to the United States Census Bureu data, in 2017, the estimated population for the 
## country was 325,719,178 people. More specifically, according to 2016 data, 61.3% of the 
## population were only white with no Hispanic or Latino origin. In contrast, 1.3% were 
## American Indian and Alaskan Native alone, 5.7% were Asian alone, 0.2% were Hawaiian and/or
## Pacific Islander, 13.3% were Black or African American.


## You may think at first, "but the bar shows that more white people were killed altogether,
## but that's when you have to read into the US and how our population's races are proportioned
